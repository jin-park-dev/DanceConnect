This dance is based on an easy to follow sequence of three on-beat steps, with a tap marking the fourth beat. It is styled with a fluid and seductive sway of the hips which is mesmerising to watch and just wonderful to dance! Bachata\u2019s simplicity makes it a very beginner-friendly dance, while the opportunity for musical interpretation it provides makes it truly addictive for dancers of all levels.\r\n\r\nBachata originated in the Dominican Republic and can be traced back to the early 1960\u2019s. Like many other dance styles, Bachata shares a name with the genre of music which inspired its development. Traditional Bachata music, which dates back to the early 20th century, combines European musical elements with Afro-Caribbean rhythms and can be most easily identified by its prevalent, syncopated guitar line \u2013 which is still a key characteristic of popular Bachata music today!\r\n\r\nIn its earliest days, Bachata music was known as \u201cMusica del Amargue\u201d, which can be roughly translated to \u201cmusic of bitterness\u201d. Both the music and the dance spoke of anguish, oppression and heartbreak. Like the North American Blues, it was danced by the poorest among the population, restricted to rural communities, brothels, bars and other entertainment venues which were shunned by the rich and privileged. Due to the opinion held by the societal elite that Bachata was a crude and unsophisticated dance of the lower classes, it failed to gain wider acceptance until the mid-1980\u2019s.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the 20th century, Bachata had gradually infiltrated mainstream society in the Dominican Republic and was starting to appear on the international Latin and Ballroom circuit. Over the years, Bachata was continuously reinvented as new dance professionals applied their own styles to the dance. These \u201cversions\u201d of Bachata were then taken up and popularized across the international dance scene. Though there is some disagreement within this community over the naming and authenticity of these Bachata \u2018sub-styles\u2019, three are generally recognised: Dominican, Moderna and Sensual.\r\n\r\nDominican Bachata\r\n\r\nOf the three sub-styles, this is the closest to its authentic, original form. Unlike other adaptations, Dominican Bachata is built around a square \u201cbox-step\u201d. It is usually danced in close partnership; the steps themselves are kept simple. This style features a smooth sway of the hips accentuated equally on every count.\r\n\r\nBachata Moderna\r\n\r\nAs you may have guessed by the name, this style of Bachata is a modern adaptation of the original dance. It incorporates more upper-body movements and more highly accentuated lower-body styling. Bachata Moderna adopts many of the turn patterns common in Salsa and is built around a \u201cside-together-side\u201d basic step, rather than the traditional square pattern.\r\n\r\nSensual Bachata\r\n\r\nThis is the youngest of the three sub-styles. Sensual Bachata uses the same basic step pattern as Moderna but less complex turn patterns. The movement within this sub-style is very much dictated by a dynamic interpretation of the music; it is characterized by fluid, whole-body stylistic movements such as body waves as well as shoulder, rib-cage and hip isolations.\r\n\r\nBachata Fusion\r\n\r\nAt Dancing Fever, we teach a hybrid style known as Bachata Fusion which incorporates elements from each of the above mentioned sub-styles. This allows our students to experience a taste of everything that contemporary Bachata has to offer. The variety taught in Bachata Fusion provides a wide range of movement possibilities for social dancing situations that will suit every dancer\u2019s individual style and preference.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dancingfever.co.uk/what-is-bachata/", "slug": "bachata"}}, {"model": "events.category", "pk": 2, "fields": {"name": "Salsa", "description_short": null, "description": "Salsa is a dance for Salsa music created by Spanish-speaking people from the Caribbean.

Also known as zouk-lambada, the dance is a descendant of lambada, the music & dance style that swept over the world like a storm in the late 1980's. Brazilian zouk is characterized by the dancers\u2019 undulating bodies and the girls' flowing hair. Depending on the style of Brazilian zouk, you can see a close connection embrace and long graceful steps, strong hip movements, body isolations and upper-body torsions, wild spins and whip-like head movements. While the dance is often called sensual, it is not sexual or erotic. It is danced by people of all ages in night clubs, dance schools and events around the world!\r\n\r\nLike many dance styles, Brazilian zouk is ever evolving. There are a few different lines or styles of Brazilian zouk, the main three derivations at the moment (April 2015) being \u2018lambazouk\u2019, \u2018traditional zouk\u2019 and \u2018modern zouk\u2019.\r\n\r\nLambazouk (or zouk-lambada or Porto Seguro style) has the closest connection to lambada. Lambazouk dancers use 1-2-3 (or quick-quick-slow) rhythm and dance to a more upbeat music. The dance incorporates the accents of the music with hip movements, deep dips, whip-like head movements and fast turns. Exchanging partners mid-song, leading with only visual contact and strong positive energy are typical for lambazouk.\r\n\r\nTraditional zouk (or Rio style zouk) is a more sensual, romantic and dramatic style of Brazilian zouk. The dancers use the slow-quick-quick rhythm, marking \u2018tum\u2019 beat in the zouk music. It is common to not use only the rhythm but also the pauses, melody and lyrics in the dance as well as utilize different dynamics in the timing. Moves such as body rolls and extensions are typical as well as movements influenced by jazz, ballet and contemporary dance.\r\n\r\nModern zouk (or Neo zouk) is a highly diverse group that sums up the latest variants of Brazilian zouk. This includes styles influenced by hiphop, street dance, belly dancing, contemporary dance, modern dance and salsa, among others. The timing is based on slow-quick-quick rhythm or contratempo. There can be long breaks in the footwork, with dancers staying on the spot, using only body movements, torsions and counterbalance to paint a picture of the music.\r\n\r\nIn addition and within these three styles many professional zouk dancers have created and named their own derivations of zouk, such as Flow zouk, Mzouk, Soul zouk and Vero zouk. Some of those styles that are newer among zouk can be considered to belong to the Modern zouk category, some could be considered yet another category of their own - there is a constant discussion on how and if zouk should be categorized. The basic idea though is that all styles follow the same fundamental concepts that are shared throughout Brazilian zouk. It is surely the desire of all us zouk dancers to be able to dance with one another irrespective of the \u2018label\u2019 of zouk one may fall under.\r\n\r\nSo far zouk hasn't been discovered by the large masses and is growing mostly by word of mouth, almost entirely ignored by the media. This has created a rather unique scene that is warm and friendly, welcoming all newcomers. Many zoukers (zouk dancers) actively travel around the world to meet other dancers and to practice their skills - just like we at Zouk The World!\r\n\r\nhttp://zouktheworld.com/brazilianzouk/", "slug": "zouk"}}, {"model": "events.category", "pk": 4, "fields": {"name": "Kizomba", "description_short": null, "description": "Kizomba is a relatively newly developed dance style; it originated in Angola in the 1980\u2019s and since then has spread across the globe, taking the dance clubs of the world by storm.

The steps are remarkably simple and are danced on every beat. Kizomba\u2019s magic (and the reason for its wide-spread popularity) lies in its relationship to the music, and the finely tuned lead-follow connection that it demands. There are more or less no rules concerning step patterns; instead, musicality takes precedence. Dancers must listen, and interpret the music through their movements.\r\n\r\nEven though Kizomba is traditionally danced with torsos touching, it can also be danced in a slightly more open hold, depending on the preference of the dancers. So, don\u2019t be put off by the intimacy that the dance portrays.
